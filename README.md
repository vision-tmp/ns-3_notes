# ns-3_notes

This project is intended to be a collection of notes, tips and maybe tutorials on different aspects of network modeling on the base of ns-3 software.

Currently, I've uploaded [the detailed description](ns3_model.txt) of the internals of ns-3 library with respect to process of sending a packet through different network layers. As an example, a specific case is represented (UDP, adhoc Wi-Fi, IPv4). But it gives a deeper understanding of how different C++ techniques are combined to model a packet transmission within the framework of ns-3. It could be helpful for implementing new protocols and network components using ns-3 library.
